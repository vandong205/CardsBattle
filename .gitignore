# This .gitignore file is based on the official Unity.gitignore template by GitHub.
# It is designed to ignore common Unity-generated files, temporary build artifacts,
# and other unnecessary files for version control.

# =============== Unity Generated Files ===============
# These files are typically generated by Unity and can be safely ignored.
# Committing them can lead to large repository sizes, unnecessary merge conflicts,
# and issues when collaborators use different Unity versions or platforms.

# Library folder: Contains asset databases, caches, and other generated files.
# It is regenerated when a project is opened in Unity.
/[Ll]ibrary/

# Temp folder: Stores temporary build files and intermediate data.
/[Tt]emp/

# Obj folder: Used by Visual Studio/MonoDevelop for compiled object files.
/[Oo]bj/

# Build and Builds folders: Common locations for project builds.
/[Bb]uild/
/[Bb]uilds/

# UserSettings folder: Specific to a user's Unity editor preferences.
/[Uu]ser[Ss]ettings/

# AssetStoreTools folder: Generated by the Asset Store Tools package.
/Assets/AssetStoreTools/

# Packages folder: For Unity Package Manager (UPM) cached packages.
# Ignoring this prevents committing package source code that can be
# downloaded by Unity or referenced via the manifest.json.
# This is crucial for keeping repo size down, especially for Burst.
